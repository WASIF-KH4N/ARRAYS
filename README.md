# ARRAYS
In C++, arrays are a fundamental data structure that allows you to store a collection of values of the same type. A single-dimensional array, also known as a one-dimensional array, is a sequence of objects of the same type that occupy a contiguous area of memory, where each element is identified by an index or subscript that allows you to access and manipulate its value. On the other hand, a multidimensional array is an array of arrays, where each element is itself an array, such as a two-dimensional array that can be thought of as a table with rows and columns, where each element is identified by a pair of indices. Multidimensional arrays can have more than two dimensions, allowing you to represent complex data structures such as 3D matrices or higher-dimensional tensors, and are stored in row-major order, meaning that the elements of each row are stored contiguously in memory, allowing for efficient iteration and manipulation of the array elements.
